# Seta00's TF2 Configs

- HUD is a slightly customized version of [KBNHud](https://code.google.com/p/kbnhud/).
- Spy config has automatic revolver hiding after the first shot and disguise-after-attack.
- All classes have color changing crosshairs
- R is viewmodel toggle (disable that if you don't use automatic reloading)
- `minecraft.cfg` is Chris' maxframes with minor tweaks (sprays, shadows, etc)
